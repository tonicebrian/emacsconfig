Example rect-mark keyboard and mouse bindings for picture mode.

\(fn)" nil nil)

(autoload 'rm-set-mark "rect-mark/rect-mark" "\
Set mark like `set-mark-command' but anticipates a rectangle.
This arranges for the rectangular region between point and mark
to be highlighted using the same face that is used to highlight
the region in `transient-mark-mode'.  This special state lasts only
until the mark is deactivated, usually by executing a text-modifying
command like \\[kill-rectangle], by inserting text, or by typing \\[keyboard-quit].

With optional argument FORCE, arrange for tabs to be expanded and
for spaces to inserted as necessary to keep the region perfectly
rectangular.  This is the default in `picture-mode'.

\(fn FORCE)" t nil)

(autoload 'rm-exchange-point-and-mark "rect-mark/rect-mark" "\
Like `exchange-point-and-mark' but treats region as a rectangle.
See `rm-set-mark' for more details.

With optional argument FORCE, tabs are expanded and spaces are
inserted as necessary to keep the region perfectly rectangular.
This is the default in `picture-mode'.

\(fn FORCE)" t nil)

(autoload 'rm-kill-region "rect-mark/rect-mark" "\
Like kill-rectangle except the rectangle is also saved in the kill ring.
Since rectangles are not ordinary text, the killed rectangle is saved
in the kill ring as a series of lines, one for each row of the rectangle.
The rectangle is also saved as the killed rectangle so it is available for
insertion with yank-rectangle.

\(fn START END)" t nil)

(autoload 'rm-kill-ring-save "rect-mark/rect-mark" "\
Copies the region like rm-kill-region would but the rectangle isn't killed.

\(fn START END)" t nil)

(autoload 'rm-mouse-drag-region "rect-mark/rect-mark" "\
Highlight a rectangular region of text as the the mouse is dragged over it.
This must be bound to a button-down mouse event.

\(fn START-EVENT)" t nil)
